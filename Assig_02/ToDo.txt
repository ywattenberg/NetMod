# Task 2
-   2) evidence agains transitivity? H0: there is transitivity, H1: no transitivity??

# QA Session lecture
- set a seed
- hand in: html, .Rmd
- add new hypotheses to the main model

## parameter interpretation:
- nice interpretation if you see a lot af triangels can come from homophily, transitivity, ...
- just interprete sign, significance not the odds! (good explanation in the presentation of odds)
- asymptotic estimation of theta is normal dist - which can be tested.
